He works as Associate Professor for Artificial Intelligence at the Swiss University of Applied Sciences Berne and Adjunct Professor for Information Security at the Swiss University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW). His current research focus is on cloud-scale machine learning and deep learning using open source technologies including TensorFlow, Keras, and the Apache Spark stack. 

Recently he joined the Linux Foundation AI as lead for the Trusted AI technical workgroup with focus on Deep Learning Adversarial Robustness, Fairness and Explainability.

He also contributes to various open source projects. He regularly speaks at international conferences including significant publications in the area of data mining, machine learning and Blockchain technologies. 

Romeo is lead instructor of the Advance Data Science specialisation on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm with courses on Scalable Data Science, Advanced Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Applied AI with DeepLearning

He published a book on Mastering Apache Spark V2.X (http://amzn.to/2vUHkGl) which has been translated into Chinese (http://www.flag.com.tw/books/product/FT363). 

He published a book on "What's new in TensorFlow 2.x" with O'Reilly (https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/whats-new-in/9781492073727/)

Recently, he lead the donation of the JupyterLab/Elyra nocode/locode Data and AI system to the Linux Foundation AI. Elyra democratizes Data and AI Pipeline development, execution and productionization.

He is also main author and contributor to the CLAIMED framework - the Component Library for AI, Machine Learning, ETL and Data Science which further democratizes Data and AI by providing opinionated, coarse grained reusable component for Data and AI including TrustedAI.

Romeo Kienzler is a member of the IBM Technical Expert Council and the IBM Academy of Technology - IBM’s leading brain trusts. #ibmaot
